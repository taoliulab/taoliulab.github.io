Teaching is the best approach to review old knowledge and to learn new
knowledge together with young people. When I was in UB, I taught
Biochemistry for undergrads and Bioinformatics for grads. Now at
Roswell Park, I am the coordinator of the RPG520 -- Principle of
computational oncology, and participating in the UB BMS515 for the
bioinformatics section. Our department of Biostatistics and
Bioinformatics is looking for enthusiastic students to join our
[Cancer Genomics and Computational Oncology (CGCO) PhD
track](https://www.roswellpark.org/education/masters-phd-programs/phd-program/genomics-computational-oncology),
of which I am the associate director on the Computational Oncology
arm.
