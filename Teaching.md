Teaching is the best approach to review old knowledge and to learn new knowledge together with young people. When I was in UB, I taught Biochemistry and Bioinformatics. Now at Roswell Park, I am the coordinator of the RPG520 -- Principle of computational oncology, and participating in the UB BMS515 for the bioinformatics section.
