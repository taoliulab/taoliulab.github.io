# Research Overview

My long-term research interest is to develop and apply computational
approaches for studying transcriptional and epigenetic regulation. My
group at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center focuses on building
bioinformatics algorithms for single-cell genomics assays to study
gene regulatory mechanisms and the influence of the genetic variations
at cis-regulatory elements. I am maintaining some widely used
bioinformatics algorithms for genomics analysis such as MACS for
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation with High-throughput Sequencing. I have
close collaborations with experimentalists, biologists and clinicians
in various fields.
