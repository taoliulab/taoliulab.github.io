# Research overview

My research develops and applies computational methods to study transcriptional and epigenetic regulation. My group focuses on open-source software for epigenomics and single-cell genomics, with an emphasis on regulatory mechanisms in cancer. A current focus is developing AI agents for genomics data reuse and metadata standardization.

I developed MACS, a widely used algorithm for ChIP-seq and related assays (cited >19,000 times in Google Scholar), and contributed to development of the Cistrome platform for integrative analysis of cis-regulatory elements. I previously served in the ENCODE and modENCODE Data Analysis Center and Analysis Working Group, where I contributed to large-scale chromatin-profile analysis and comparative regulatory genomics across model organisms and human. I also contributed to community ChIP-seq best-practice guidelines.

I am the principal investigator of the MACS3 project, supported by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. I currently serve as technical lead for the [NCI ARTNet](https://www.nciartnet.org/) Coordinating and Data Management Center, the [NCI CAP-IT](https://www.ncicapit.org/) Data and Resource Coordination Center, and the [NCI CIPNET](https://nci-cipnet.org/) Data and Resource Coordination Center. At Roswell Park, I am a member of the Developmental Therapeutics Program under the Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG).

## Algorithm development for epigenomics data

A central component of my program is method development for high-throughput sequencing assays that profile functional regulatory elements. My colleagues and I studied technical noise in ChIP-seq and developed dynamic Poisson-model-based approaches to detect transcription factor binding sites and histone-marked regions. MACS remains an active focus in my lab, with ongoing work to improve accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency.

Beyond ChIP-seq, we have developed methods for CUT&RUN and ATAC-seq and are extending this framework to single-cell genomic assays.

## Epigenomics databases, knowledgebases, and infrastructure

I have led projects that reduce technical barriers to next-generation sequencing analysis. I led a joint Harvard–Eli Lilly team that developed the web-based Cistrome Analysis Pipeline, enabling users to upload ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data and run curated downstream analyses in an integrated environment.

With colleagues at Harvard, I also helped build downstream analysis tools, large-scale databases of public human and mouse ChIP-seq datasets, and search systems that were integrated into the broader Cistrome ecosystem.

## Consortium contributions

I have participated in multiple NIH-funded consortia, including ENCODE, modENCODE, and Cancer Moonshot programs, to study transcriptional and epigenetic regulation in model organisms and human systems.

In this work, my collaborators and I reported that H3K36me3 is linked to exon-intron structure and splicing in eukaryotes. We also characterized broad chromosomal domains of histone modifications in *C. elegans* and examined developmental changes in genome organization. More recently, with IOTN Moonshot collaborators at Dana-Farber, we identified epigenetic roles of MUC1 in cancer stem-cell biology.

## Collaborative studies of epigenetic regulation

In parallel with methods and infrastructure development, I collaborate with experimental biologists to study epigenetic regulation across tissues and developmental stages.

With collaborators at UPenn, we used mouse models to show that histone deacetylase-mediated epigenetic regulation changes across circadian time in a cell-intrinsic clock framework. In collaboration with colleagues at UB, we combined chromatin immunoprecipitation, RNA-expression assays, and single-cell experiments to study retinal ganglion cell development in mouse.
