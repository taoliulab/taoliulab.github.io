Our new study is published in **Cell Reports**:

This study identifies the AR coregulator **WDR77** as a key driver of treatment-resistant prostate cancer progression and shows that AR and WDR77 have substantial overlap in genomic action. We found that directly disrupting AR–WDR77 interaction reduces AR DNA binding and AR-dependent transcription, suppresses proliferation in AR-positive prostate cancer models, and delays growth in patient-derived xenograft and fresh-specimen organoid systems. Together, the work supports AR–WDR77 interaction as a promising therapeutic target for disease that progresses after androgen-deprivation therapy.
