Our review article is published in **Genomics, Proteomics & Bioinformatics**:

This review gives a practical overview of the computational landscape for single-cell ATAC-seq, from core processing steps to higher-level biological interpretation. It discusses common analytical tasks such as quality control, feature/peak representation, clustering, cell-type annotation, trajectory and regulatory inference, and integration with other modalities. It also highlights open challenges that still affect day-to-day analysis, including sparsity, batch effects, benchmarking gaps, and reproducibility across pipelines.
