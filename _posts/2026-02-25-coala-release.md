We are excited to announce the release of **coala** (Command-line LLM-agent Adapter), a standards-based framework for converting command-line tools into agentic toolsets. coala bridges the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** and **Common Workflow Language (CWL)** so that existing CLI tools can be exposed to LLM agents without writing one-off wrappers for each tool. By treating tool definitions as data, running tools in containerized environments, and keeping execution local when needed, coala emphasizes reproducibility, low maintenance overhead, and practical use in scientific computing workflows. The project is led by **Qiang Hu** at Roswell Park. Learn more at <https://coala.info>.
