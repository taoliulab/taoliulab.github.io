We are excited to share the release of **coala**, a framework for converting command-line tools into agentic toolsets.

- Project website: <https://coala.info>
- Main developer: **Qiang Hu** (Dr. Liu's colleague at Roswell Park)

coala helps bridge existing CLI ecosystems with modern agent workflows, making it easier to expose reliable tools to AI assistants.
